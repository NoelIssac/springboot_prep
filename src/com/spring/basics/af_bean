 scope of bean
singleton  - one instance - default scope
prototype - create a new instance whenever request for it comes
request - web app context. One bean per HTTP request.
session - web app context. One bean per HTTP request.

how singleton pattern instance and bean differs?
one and only one instance per class loader
Spring singleton is one instance of bean per container
(one instance per application context)

we use @scope annotation to define the scope
