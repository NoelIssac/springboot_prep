Setter Injection and Constructor Injection

Setter Injection
-----------------
@Component
public class TodoBusinessService {
    TodoDataService dataService;

    @Autowired
    public void setDataService(TodoDataService dataService) {
        this.dataService = dataService;
    }
}

// Using Reflection
public class TodoBusinessService {
    @Autowired
    TodoDataService dataService;
}

Constructor Injection
---------------------
@Component
public class TodoBusinessService {

    @Autowired
    TodoDataService dataService;

    public TodoBusinessService(TodoDataService dataService) {
        super();
        this.dataService = dataService;
    }
}


Spring team advocates Constructor injection
1. Promotes immutability coz setter injection can be called again and again
by calling the set methods again and again.
2. WHen too many dependencies in construction shows that there is a code smell
and calls for refactoring
